# django_blog
creating a nice 2018 blog with backend as django2 and python3

# Start Django Project

1. Install virtualenv for creating virtual environment

	```
	pip install virtualenv
	```

2. Create a virtualenv and activate it

	```
	> virtualenv env
	> env/source/activate
	(env)>
	```

	**NOTE:** run all the upcoming commands inside virtualenv

3. Install requirements

	```
	pip install django
	```

4. Start Django Project

	```
	django-admin startproject website .
	```

	**NOTE:** trailing ```.``` at end tells django to create project files inside current directory, to check what I mean run the same command without ```.```

5. Run the server

	```
	python manage.py runserver
	```

**NOTE:** ignore any warnings and locate to [this](http://127.0.0.1:8000) url.

6. Create Super User

	```
	python manage.py createsuperuser
	```

Enter the **username** and **password** and email (optional) for django-admin site. This can be done while server is running, once done locate to [this]http://127.0.0.1:8000admin) url and enter your details.

# Starting App
For starting new app in django run the following comman

```
python manage.py startapp posts
```

Notice a new folder **posts** created in root folder

**posts** app contains the following folder and files which django creates by itself

```
+ posts
	+ migrations
	- __init__.py
	- admin.py
	- apps.py
	- models.py
	- tests.py
	- views.py
```

The next thing we need to do is tell our django project about our posts app.
For that we need to add our app in project settings -- ```settings.py``` 

**website/setting.py**
```
# Application definition

INSTALLED_APPS = [
    'django.contrib.admin',
    'django.contrib.auth',
    'django.contrib.contenttypes',
    'django.contrib.sessions',
    'django.contrib.messages',
    'django.contrib.staticfiles',
    'posts', 		# posts app
]
```

Thats' it!

# Create Post Model
So according to Django [Docs](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.1/topics/db/models/) Model is 

```
A model is the single, definitive source of information about your data. It contains 
the essential fields and behaviors of the data youâ€™re storing. Generally, each model 
maps to a single database table.
```

So for creating a model for our posts app we will be writing code in **posts/models.py**

Django has built in Model and Model Fields so open **posts/models.py** file and you already have the ```models``` imported from ```django.db```

```
from django.db import models
```

Now we will create our own model particularly for our posts app which will have two
field actually four but the other two will be handled by django automatically

```
from django.db import models

class Post(models.Model):
	title = models.CharField(max_length=200)
	content = models.TextField()
	timestamp = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
	updated = models.DateTimeField(auto_now=True)

	def __str__(self):
		return self.title

```

You might be familiar with class inheritance in python ```class Post(models.Model):```
which is used here and we have made four fields 

1. **title** -- CharField with max characters 200 for title of post
2. **content** -- TextField for content of post
3. **timestamp** -- DateTimeField for recording time of creation of post 
	**Notice** the ```auto_now_add=True``` argument passed with ```DateTimeField```.
	This argument tells the django model to save the current date and time everytime a post object is created
4. **updated** -- DateTimeField with ```auto_now=True``` that tells django to save 
	current date and time everytime a already existing post is edited.
5. ```__str__``` method that returns ```title``` of post whenever the object is printed

# Model To Admin
Head onto Django Admin [Docs](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.1/ref/contrib/admin/)
and check out how admin works in django

For actually registering our Post model into the admin site we need to do that using
```admin.site.register``` inside ```posts/admin.py```

```
from django.contrib import admin

from .models import Post

admin.site.register(Post)
```

So what we did is import our Post Model and then register it with admin.

Run the server again and head to [admin](http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin) site and you 
should see the ```Post``` Model, click on it and create few posts save them.

You will find that a list of posts appear with the heading as the title of the post
which is due to the ```__str__``` method inside ```model.py```

# Customizing Admin
In this section we will add some features to our admin site for Post model. For that we
need to create a [ModelAdmin](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.1/ref/contrib/admin/#modeladmin-objects)

Open **posts/admin.py** file again and create a new ModelAdmin class

```
from django.contrib import admin

from .models import Post

class PostModelAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
	class Meta:
		model = Post


admin.site.register(Post, PostModelAdmin)
```

This won't change anything on admin site, but using ModelAdmin [options](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.1/ref/contrib/admin/#modeladmin-options) would give us a whole lot of features.

We will add ```list_display``` feature that displays the fields inside the list/set into
the display of Model.

```
...
class PostModelAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
	list_display = ('title', 'timestamp')
	
	class Meta:
		model = Post
...
```

Notice how ```title``` field on Post Model page is clickable, we can make other fields
also clickable using ```list_display_links```

```
class PostModelAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
	list_display = ('title', 'timestamp', 'updated')
	list_display_links = ('title', 'timestamp')

	class Meta:
		model = Post
```

Again our model admin site is changed a bit.

There is also a ```list_filter``` feature that adds a filter onto right side with
the filter fields provided

```
	...
	list_filter = ('updated', 'timestamp')
	...
```

We can add a search field onto Model Site using ```search_fields``` feature like this

```
search_fields = ('title', 'content')
```

Enter the title or content of a post and search, you will get the results

One more very nice feature is quick editable using ```list_editable```

```
list_display_links = ('timestamp',)
list_editable = ('title',)
```

Since you added ```title``` to ```list_editable``` we need to remove the it from 
```list_display_links``` this makes sense cause we cannot make one field clickable as 
well as editable.

To change the model for example if we want to change the max_length paramter to 120 
then we would simply make changes in the file 
```title = models.CharField(max_length=120)``` but we need to do one more thing.

After making changes to fields in models we need to run ```makemigrations``` command
and then ```migrate```

```
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
```

If you have any questions regarding what we have done so far let me know at [CodeMentor](http://www.codementor.tk)

# [CRUD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete)
1. Create
2. Retrieve
3. Update
4. Delete

Creating something refers to **CREATE**. Retrieving data is **RETRIEVE**. Updating the
existing data is **UPDATE** and lastly deleting the data comes under **DELETE**

In this section we will be creating **CRUD** functionality for our blog just like how
**Django Admin** works, our **CRUD** won't be as advanced and featureful as Django Admin
is but something that fulfills our requirements.

We are gonna create views for our CRUD functionality inside ```views.py```
We will be starting with [function based views](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.1/topics/http/views/)

A simple function based view can be created through

**posts/view.py**
```
from django.shortcuts import render
from django.http import HttpResponse

def posts_home(request):
	return HttpResponse("<h1>Django Blog Home Page</h1>")

```

So we have a simple python function that returns a ```http.HttpResponse(html)```
object which will be shown on the url that is mapped with this view, more on that later.

Function based views are simple functions that needs to return some response everytime
the function is called. So our function takes in a argument ```request``` and it simply
returns and ```HttpResponse``` object with simple html inside it, this html will be 
rendered by browser so we don't need to worry about that.

Okay! We have our view ready now we want a url for this particular view.

**website/urls.py**
```
from django.contrib import admin
from django.urls import path

urlpatterns = [
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
    path('posts/', admin.site.urls),
]

```

Inside ```urls.py``` file we have just copy pasted the already existing url and changed
the string inside quotes to ```posts``` and if we run server 
```python manage.py runserver``` and navigate to [127.0.0.1:8000/posts/](http://127.0.0.1:8000/posts/) we find that we arrived at the same admin page. This is because we haven't mapped 
our url with the function based view ```posts_home(request)``` that we created.

To map our url with that view we need to import our view and define it with url

```
...
urlpatterns = [
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
    path('posts/', posts_home, name='posts-home'),
]
```

Run server and navigate to refresh the page and you should see the html response that 
we returned from our **posts view**

This makes sense right! We created a view then a url for that view and joined them 
together and magic happens. We have our first MVC ready. The same way we will create the
other views for our **CRUD** and individual urls for each view.

You might be wondering that we didn't talked about the ```name``` argument. So let's talk 
about it. ```django.urls.path``` has ```name``` argument that is very useful in cases
when we want to denote our url so instead of completely writing our url 
```http://127.0.0.1:8000/posts/``` like this we can simply use the name ```posts-home```

We will dive into that later on.
